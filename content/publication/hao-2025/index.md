abstract: Global warming is altering flood risks induced by rain-on-snow events. However,
  decision-makers lack guidance on how rain-on-snow induced extreme floods could be
  altered with warming. Here, storyline analyses using a kilometer-scale land surface
  model reveal diverse responses of four historically-impactful, decision-relevant
  rain-on-snow induced extreme flood events over the contiguous U.S. to warming, due
  to alterations in their water budgets. For the 2017-Feb California floods, runoff
  first increases and then decreases with warming, peaking under the +3Ã¾inspaceK scenario,
  while runoff of the 2017-Jan California floods increases monotonically by ~53%/K.
  Contrastingly, runoff of the 1996-Jan Mid-Atlantic floods decreases gradually with
  warming. Despite these differences, warming generally shifts flood-generating regimes
  along elevation profiles. High elevations could experience notably increased runoff,
  while low elevations encounter a shift from rain-on-snow-driven to rainfall-dominated
  runoff. These findings underscore the need for flood control planning to quantify
  region- and elevation-specific changes in rain-on-snow events in a warmer climate.
