abstract: Abstract Ground heat flux (G0) is a key component of the land-surface energy
  balance of high-latitude regions. Despite its crucial role in controlling permafrost
  degradation due to global warming, G0 is sparsely measured and not well represented
  in the outputs of global scale model simulation. In this study, an analytical heat
  transfer model is tested to reconstruct G0 across seasons using soil temperature
  series from field measurements, Global Climate Model, and climate reanalysis outputs.
  The probability density functions of ground heat flux and of model parameters are
  inferred using available G0 data (measured or modeled) for snow-free period as a
  reference. When observed G0 is not available, a numerical model is applied using
  estimates of surface heat flux (dependent on parameters) as the top boundary condition.
  These estimates (and thus the corresponding parameters) are verified by comparing
  the distributions of simulated and measured soil temperature at several depths.
  Aided by state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods, the developed G0 reconstruction
  approach provides novel means for assessing the probabilistic structure of the ground
  heat flux for regional permafrost change studies.
