abstract: Abstract Flow direction modeling consists of (a) an accurate representation
  of the river network and (b) digital elevation model (DEM) processing to preserve
  characteristics with hydrological significance. In part 1 of our study, we presented
  a mesh-independent approach to representing river networks on different types of
  meshes. This follow-up part 2 study presents a novel DEM processing approach for
  flow direction modeling. This approach consists of (a) a topological relationship-based
  hybrid breaching-filling method to conduct stream burning for the river network
  and (b) a modified depression removal method for rivers and hillslopes. Our methods
  reduce modifications to surface elevations and provide a robust two-step procedure
  to remove local depressions in DEM. They are mesh-independent and can be applied
  to both structured and unstructured meshes. We applied our new methods with different
  model configurations to the Susquehanna River Basin. The results show that topological
  relationship-based stream burning and depression-filling methods can reproduce the
  correct river networks, providing high-quality flow direction and other characteristics
  for hydrologic and Earth system models.
