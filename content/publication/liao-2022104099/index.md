abstract: Watershed delineation and flow direction representation are the foundations
  of streamflow routing in spatially distributed hydrologic modeling. A recent study
  showed that hexagon-based watershed discretization has several advantages compared
  to the traditional Cartesian (latitudeâ€“longitude) discretization, such as uniform
  connectivity and compatibility with other Earth system model components based on
  unstructured mesh systems (e.g., oceanic models). Despite these advantages, hexagon-based
  discretization has not been widely adopted by the current generation of hydrologic
  models. One major reason is that there is no existing model that can delineate hexagon-based
  watersheds while maintaining accurate representations of flow direction across various
  spatial resolutions. In this study, we explored approaches such as spatial resampling
  and hybrid breaching-filling stream burning techniques to improve watershed delineation
  and flow direction representation using a newly developed hexagonal mesh watershed
  delineation model (HexWatershed). We applied these improvements to the Columbia
  River basin and performed 16 simulations with different configurations. The results
  show that (1) spatial resampling modulates flow direction around headwaters and
  provides an opportunity to extract subgrid information; and (2) stream burning corrects
  the flow directions in mountainous areas with complex terrain features.
