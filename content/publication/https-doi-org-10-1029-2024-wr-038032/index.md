abstract: Abstract Flooding is one of the most impactful weather-related natural hazards.
  Numerical models that solve the two dimensional (2D) shallow water equations (SWE)
  represent the first-principles approach to simulate all types of spatial flooding,
  such as pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flooding, and their compound dynamics. High
  spatial resolution (e.g., O $mathcalO$ (100âˆ’101 $10^0-10^1$) m) is needed in 2D
  SWE simulations to capture flood dynamics accurately, resulting in formidable computational
  challenges. Thus, relatively coarser spatial resolutions are used for large-scale
  simulations of flooding, which introduce uncertainties in the results. It is unclear
  how the uncertainty associated with the model resolution compares to the uncertainties
  in precipitation data sets and assumptions regarding boundary conditions when channelized
  flows interact with other water bodies. In this study, we compare these three sources
  of uncertainties in 2D SWE simulations for the 2017 Houston flooding event. Our
  results show that precipitation uncertainty and mesh resolution have more significant
  impacts on the simulated streamflow and inundation dynamics than the choice of the
  downstream boundary condition at the watershed outlet. We point out the viability
  to confine the uncertainty of coarsening mesh resolution by using the variable resolution
  mesh (VRM) which refines critical topographic features with far fewer grid cells.
  Specifically, in simulations with VRM, the simulated inundation depths over the
  refined region are comparable to that use the finest uniform mesh. This study contributes
  to understanding the challenges and pathways for applying 2D SWE models to improve
  the realism of flood simulations over large scales.
