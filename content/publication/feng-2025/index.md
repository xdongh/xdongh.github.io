abstract: The Amazon River carries enormous amounts of sediment from the Andes mountains,
  much of which is deposited in its floodplains. However, accurate quantification
  of the sediment sink at fine spatiotemporal scales is still challenging. Here, we
  present a high-resolution hydrodynamic-sediment model to simulate sediment deposition
  in a representative Amazon/Solimões floodplain. The process is found to be jointly
  driven by inundation, suspended sediment concentration in the Amazon River, and
  floodplain hydrodynamics and only weakly correlated with inundation level. By upscaling
  the sediment deposition rate (1.33 textpm 0.24 kg m−2 yr−1), we estimate the trapping
  of 77.3 textpm 13.9 Mt (or 6.1 textpm 1%) of the Amazon River sediment by the Amazon/Solimões
  floodplains every year. Widespread deforestation would reduce the trapping efficiency
  of the floodplains over time, exacerbating downstream river aggradation. Additionally,
  we show that the deposition of sediment-associated organic carbon plays a minor
  role in fueling carbon dioxide and methane emissions in the Amazon.
