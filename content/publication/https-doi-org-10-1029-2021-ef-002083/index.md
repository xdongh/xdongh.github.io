abstract: Abstract The earth's hydroclimate is continuing to change, and the corresponding
  impacts on water resource space-time distribution need to be understood to mitigate
  their socioeconomic consequences. A variety of ecosystem services, transport processes,
  and human activities are synced with the timing of peak annual runoff. To understand
  the influence of changing hydroclimate on peak runoff dates across the continental
  United States, we downscaled outputs of 10 Global Circulation Models for different
  future scenarios. Our results quantify robust spatial patterns of both negative
  (up to 3–5 weeks) and positive (up to 2–4 weeks) shifts in the dates of peak annual
  runoff occurrence by the end of this century. In snowmelt-dominated areas, annual
  maxima are projected to shift to earlier dates due to the corresponding changes
  in snow accumulation timing. For regions in which the occurrence of springtime extreme
  soil wetness shifts to later time, we find that peak annual runoff is also projected
  to be delayed. These patterns of runoff timing change tend to be more pronounced
  for projections of higher greenhouse concentration in the future.
