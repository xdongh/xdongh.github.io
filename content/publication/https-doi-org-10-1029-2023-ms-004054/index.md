abstract: Abstract Coastal zone compound flooding (CF) can be caused by the interactive
  fluvial and oceanic processes, particularly when coastal backwater propagates upstream
  and interacts with high river discharge. The modeling of CF is limited in existing
  Earth System Models (ESMs) due to coarse mesh resolutions and one-way coupled river-ocean
  components. In this study, we present a novel multi-scale coupling framework within
  the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), integrating global atmosphere and
  land with interactively coupled river and ocean models using different meshes with
  refined resolutions near the coastline. To evaluate this framework, we conducted
  ensemble simulations of a CF event (Hurricane Irene in 2011) in a Mid-Atlantic estuary.
  The results demonstrate that the novel E3SM configuration can reasonably reproduce
  river discharge and sea surface height variations. The two-way river-ocean coupling
  improves the representation of coastal backwater effects at the terrestrial-aquatic
  interface that are caused by the combined actions of tide and storm surge during
  the CF event, thus providing a valuable modeling tool for better understanding the
  river-estuary-ocean dynamics in extreme events under climate change. Notably, our
  results show that the most significant CF impacts occur when the highest storm surge
  generated by a tropical cyclone meets with a moderate river discharge. This study
  highlights the state-of-the-art advancements developed within E3SM for simulating
  multi-scale coastal processes.
