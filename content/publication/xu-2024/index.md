abstract: Climate change can alter wetland extent and function, but such impacts are
  perplexing. Here, changes in wetland characteristics over North America from 25°
  to 53° North are projected under two climate scenarios using a state-of-the-science
  Earth system model. At the continental scale, annual wetland area decreases by ~10%
  (6%-14%) under the high emission scenario, but spatiotemporal changes vary, reaching
  up to textpm50%. As the dominant driver of these changes shifts from precipitation
  to temperature in the higher emission scenario, wetlands undergo substantial drying
  during summer season when biotic processes peak. The projected disruptions to wetland
  seasonality cycles imply further impacts on biodiversity in major wetland habitats
  of upper Mississippi, Southeast Canada, and the Everglades. Furthermore, wetlands
  are projected to significantly shrink in cold regions due to the increased infiltration
  as warmer temperature reduces soil ice. The large dependence of the projections
  on climate change scenarios underscores the importance of emission mitigation to
  sustaining wetland ecosystems in the future.
