abstract: Abstract Applications of process-based models (PBM) for predictions are
  confounded by multiple uncertainties and computational burdens, resulting in appreciable
  errors. A novel modeling framework combining a high-fidelity PBM with surrogate
  and machine learning (ML) models is developed to tackle these challenges and applied
  for streamflow prediction. A surrogate model permits high computational efficiency
  of a PBM solution at a minimum loss of its accuracy. A novel probabilistic ML model
  partitions the PBM-surrogate prediction errors into reducible and irreducible types,
  quantifying their distributions that arise due to both explicitly perceived uncertainties
  (such as parametric) or those that are entirely hidden to the modeler (not included
  or unexpected). Using this approach, we demonstrate a substantial improvement of
  streamflow predictive accuracy for a case study urbanized watershed. Such a framework
  provides an efficient solution combining the strengths of high-fidelity and physics-agnostic
  models for a wide range of prediction problems in geosciences.
