abstract: Abstract River networks are important features in surface hydrology. However,
  accurately representing river networks in spatially distributed hydrologic and Earth
  system models is often sensitive to the model's spatial resolution. Specifically,
  river networks are often misrepresented because of the mismatch between the model's
  spatial resolution and river network details, resulting in significant uncertainty
  in the projected flow direction. In this study, we developed a topological relationship-based
  river network representation method for spatially distributed hydrologic models.
  This novel method uses (a) graph theory algorithms to simplify real-world vector-based
  river networks and assist in mesh generation; and (b) a topological relationship-based
  method to reconstruct conceptual river networks. The main advantages of our method
  are that (a) it combines the strengths of vector-based and DEM raster-based river
  network extraction methods; and (b) it is mesh-independent and can be applied to
  both structured and unstructured meshes. This method paves a path for advanced terrain
  analysis and hydrologic modeling across different scales.
