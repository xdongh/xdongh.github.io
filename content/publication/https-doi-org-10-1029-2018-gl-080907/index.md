abstract: Abstract Energy budget of Amazonian forests has a large influence on regional
  and global climate, but relevant data are scarce. A novel energy partition method
  based on the maximum entropy production (MEP) theory is applied to simulate evapotranspiration
  in Amazonia. Using site-level eddy flux data, the MEP method shows high skill at
  the hourly, daily, and monthly scales. Consistent performance under different levels
  of land surface dryness is revealed, hinting that drought signal is appropriately
  resolved. The site-level MEP-based estimates outperform the estimates of the Moderate
  Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer evapotranspiration product, which is commonly
  used for large-scale assessments. At the Amazon basin scale, the two series yield
  similar averages but exhibit spatial differences. The parameter parsimony and demonstrated
  skill of the MEP method make it an attractive approach for environments with diverse
  strategies of water flux control.
