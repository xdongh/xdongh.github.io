abstract: Abstract Flow routing is a fundamental process of Earth System Models' (ESMs)
  river component. Traditional flow routing models rely on Cartesian rectangular meshes,
  which exhibit limitations, particularly when coupled with unstructured mesh-based
  ocean components. They also lack the support for regionally refined models. While
  previous studies have highlighted the potential benefits of unstructured meshes
  for flow routing, their widespread application and comprehensive evaluation within
  ESMs remain limited. This study extends the river component of the Energy Exascale
  Earth System Model to unstructured Voronoi meshes. We evaluated the model's performance
  in simulating river discharge and water depth across three watersheds spanning the
  Arctic, temperate, and tropical regions. The results show that while providing several
  benefits, unstructured mesh-based flow routing can achieve comparable performance
  to structured mesh-based routing, and their difference is often less than $10%$.
  Although the unstructured mesh-based method could address several existing limitations,
  this research also shows that additional improvements in the numerical method are
  needed to fully exploit the advantages of unstructured mesh for hydrologic and ESMs.
