abstract: Abstract Floodplain inundation links river and land systems through significant
  water, sediment, and nutrient exchanges. However, these two-way interactions between
  land and river are currently missing in most Earth System Models. In this study,
  we introduced the two-way hydrological coupling between the land component, E3SM
  Land Model, and the river component, Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport, in
  Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to study the impacts of floodplain inundation
  on land and river processes. We calibrated the river channel geometry and developed
  a new data-driven inundation scheme to improve the simulation of inundation dynamics
  in E3SM. The new inundation scheme captures 96% of the spatial variation of inundation
  area in a satellite inundation product at global scale, in contrast with 7% when
  the default inundation scheme of E3SM was used. Global simulations including the
  new inundation scheme performed at resolution with and without land-river two-way
  coupling was used to quantify the impact of coupling. Comparisons show that two-way
  coupling modifies the water and energy cycle in 20% of the global land cells. Specifically,
  riverine inundation is reduced by two-way coupling, but inland inundation is intensified.
  Wetter periods are more impacted by the two-way coupling at the global scale, while
  regions with different climates exhibit different sensitivities. The two-way exchange
  of water between the land and river components of E3SM provides the foundation for
  enabling two-way coupling of land-river sediment and biogeochemical fluxes. These
  capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the interactions between water
  and biogeochemical cycles and their response to human perturbations.
