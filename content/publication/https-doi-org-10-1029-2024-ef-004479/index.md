abstract: Abstract Sea-level rise (SLR) poses a severe threat to the coastal environment
  through seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers. The rising groundwater table
  also exacerbates the risk of pluvial, fluvial, and groundwater flooding in coastal
  regions. However, current Earth system models (ESMs) commonly ignore the exchanges
  of water at the land-ocean interface. To address this gap, we developed a novel
  land-ocean hydrologic coupling scheme in a state-of-the-science ESM, the Energy
  Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2). The new scheme includes the lateral
  exchange between seawater and groundwater and the vertical infiltration of seawater
  driven by the SLR-induced inundation. Simulations were performed with the updated
  E3SMv2 for the global land-ocean interface to assess the impacts of SLR on coastal
  groundwater under a high CO2 emission scenario. By the middle of this century, seawater
  infiltration on the inundated areas will be the dominant component in the land-ocean
  coupling process, while the lateral subsurface flow exchange will be much smaller.
  The SLR-induced seawater infiltration will raise the groundwater levels, enhance
  evapotranspiration, and increase runoff with distinct spatial patterns globally
  in the future. Although the coupling process is induced by SLR, we found topography
  and warming temperature have more control on the coupling impacts, probably due
  to the relatively modest magnitude of SLR during the selected future period. Overall,
  our study suggests significant groundwater and seawater exchange at the land-ocean
  interface, which needs to be considered in ESMs.
