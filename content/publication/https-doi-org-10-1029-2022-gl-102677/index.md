abstract: Abstract The 21st century evapotranspiration (ET) trends over the continental
  U.S. are assessed using innovative, energy-based principles. Annual ET is projected
  to increase with high confidence at the rate of 20 mm for every 1℃ of rise in near-surface
  air temperature, or 0.45 or 0.98 mm/year/year, depending on the emission scenario.
  The ET trajectory is dominated (58%) by the increase of land-surface net radiative
  energy. An enhancement of the fraction of energy taken up by ET becomes a more important
  controller (53%) in late 21st century, under the high emission scenario. This increase
  is explained by the “tug of war” between atmospheric vapor demand and land-surface
  ability to supply water. An assessment of future water availability (precipitation
  minus ET) shows no significant changes at the continental scale. This outcome nevertheless
  hides strong spatial variability, emphasizing the role of ET in shaping the distribution
  of water availability among human populations.
