abstract: Abstract Flooding impacts are on the rise globally, and concentrated in
  urban areas. Currently, there are no operational systems to forecast flooding at
  spatial resolutions that can facilitate emergency preparedness and response actions
  mitigating flood impacts. We present a framework for real-time flood modeling and
  uncertainty quantification that combines the physics of fluid motion with advances
  in probabilistic methods. The framework overcomes the prohibitive computational
  demands of high-fidelity modeling in real-time by using a probabilistic learning
  method relying on surrogate models that are trained prior to a flood event. This
  shifts the overwhelming burden of computation to the trivial problem of data storage,
  and enables forecasting of both flood hazard and its uncertainty at scales that
  are vital for time-critical decision-making before and during extreme events. The
  framework has the potential to improve flood prediction and analysis and can be
  extended to other hazard assessments requiring intense high-fidelity computations
  in real-time.
