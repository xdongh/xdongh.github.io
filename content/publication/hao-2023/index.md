abstract: Light-absorbing particles (LAP) deposited on seasonal snowpack can result
  in snow darkening, earlier snowmelt, and regional climate change. However, their
  future evolution and contributions to snowpack change relative to global warming
  remain unclear. Here, using Earth System Model simulations, we project significantly
  reduced black carbon deposition by 2081-2100, which reduces the December-May average
  LAP-induced radiative forcing in snow over the Northern Hemisphere from 1.3 Wm−2
  during 1995-2014 to 0.65 (SSP126) and 0.49 (SSP585) Wm−2. We quantify separately
  the contributions of climate change and LAP evolution on future snowpack and demonstrate
  that projected LAP changes in snow over the Tibetan Plateau will alleviate future
  snowpack loss due to climate change by 52.1þinspacetextpmþinspace8.0% and 8.0þinspacetextpmþinspace1.1%
  at the end of the century for the two scenarios, mainly due to reduced black carbon
  contamination. Our findings highlight a cleaner snow future and its benefits for
  future water supply from snowmelt especially under the sustainable development pathway
  of SSP126.
